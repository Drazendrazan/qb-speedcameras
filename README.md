# qb-speedcameras
Originally an esx script that was "converted" to QBCore even though the files weren't using qbcore calls and were instead using nvcore
Has pre-setup cameras already and should be reasonably self explanatory for adding new cameras (go into client.lua) if anyone posts an issue about adding cameras I will add instructions here.


## Requirements
QB-PHONE | https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-phone
QB-BANKING | https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-banking
not sure about any other requirements

## Testing Results
Tested on WEEZOOKA'S RP and passed tests with flying colours even managing to fine players who were above the speed limit and caught by cameras
